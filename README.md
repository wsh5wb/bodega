Game design engine

Two running options:

* With sanitizer: `make sanitizer`

* Without sanitizer: `make`

Once compiled, use `make run` to run game


# Controls for Alpha demo

* W,A,S,D to move

* M to show map

* O to kill an enemy in room

* V to show entire map

* Arrow keys to shoot basic projectiles (sometimes the projectiles do not fire and game needs to be restarted a few times to work. We are working on this bug).

* Space to switch dungeons

* U to enter camera translation mode

While in translation mode:

* I,J,K,L to move camera between adjacent room cells
* N to reset character and camera to main room
